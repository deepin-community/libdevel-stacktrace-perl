libdevel-stacktrace-perl (2.0000-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  From upstream Changes for 2.0000:  

  [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]

  - The no_refs constructor parameter is now deprecated, and has been replaced by
    a new unsafe_ref_capture parameter that defaults to false, meaning no
    references are captured by default. Capturing references by default caused
    too many issues that couldn't be worked around, including running DESTROY
    blocks multiple times on captured objects in the worst case.

  - Removed support for the long-deprecated no_object_refs constructor parameter
    (deprecated in 2002!).
